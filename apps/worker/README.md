# 🛠️ Worker Service

Welcome to the **Worker Service**! This app powers background tasks and processing within our system.

---

## 🚀 Quick Test: Is the Worker Running?

You can verify that the worker service is up and operational by running the following command from your terminal:

```bash
curl -X POST https://starter-worker.reelfreakz.com/execute
```

If everything is working, you'll receive a response from the worker service.

### 📬 Need Help?

- Be sure your environment is up and configured (see the main project README for details).
- For more endpoints or advanced usage, check the service's API documentation.

Enjoy automating with our Worker! 😊
