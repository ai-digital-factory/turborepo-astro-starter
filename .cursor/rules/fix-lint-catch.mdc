# 🛡️ Fix Lint Catch Rule

Ensure that `pnpm lint` correctly identifies errors by refining the linting infrastructure rather than modifying the source code.

## 📋 Steps to Follow

1. **Analyze Detection Gaps**
   - Determine why the error is currently being missed.
   - **Common Root Causes:**
     - The `lint` script in `package.json` excludes specific file types or directories.
     - ESLint configuration is missing necessary plugins or parsers.
     - `.eslintignore` is over-eagerly excluding files.

2. **Refine Linting Configuration**
   - Update the `lint` command in `package.json` for broader coverage.
   - **Example:** `eslint . --ext .js,.jsx,.ts,.tsx,.astro`
   - Adjust `.eslintignore` or ESLint rules if they are suppressing the error.

3. **Strictly Configuration Only**
   - Focus entirely on the linting mechanism. Do **not** touch the code causing the error.

## 📝 Example Configuration Fix

_Apply changes to the relevant `package.json`:_

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "eslint . --ext .js,.jsx,.ts,.tsx,.astro"
  }
}
```

After implementing the fix, verify that `pnpm lint` now successfully flags the previously ignored error.

> **DO NOT FIX THE CODE TO RESOLVE THE ERROR.** Your task is exclusively to update the **linting mechanism** (commands, configurations, or ignore files) so that the error is properly caught and reported.
