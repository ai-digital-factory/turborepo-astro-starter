# Development Standards

## Code Validation

After making any code changes, **always** run the following commands to validate your changes:

1. `pnpm lint` — Run this command at the **root** of the repository to check for linting errors (not just for individual apps or packages).
2. `pnpm format` — Format the code according to project standards.

## Import Conventions

- **Absolute Imports:** Always use absolute imports with the `@/` prefix (e.g., `@/components/...`) instead of relative paths (e.g., `../../components/...`).

## Use Abort controller

- Always use the AbortController's signal for cleanup and cancellation tasks wherever applicable.
